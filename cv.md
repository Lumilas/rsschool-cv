### *Briefly About Myself:* ###

I'm Graduated of Belarussian State University with profession like logistics-economist. On univercity practice time I was in on of leading freight forwarder company in Belarus and focused on sales/opeerations side of rail shipments in CIS countries. After that i got the offer of job after unicersity and continue my career in logistics. Meanwhile, after 2 years of work I decided to change the company bcz wanted to develop my skills in other transoration modes and moved to another middle forwarder company, where after half of work year I became the Head of Logistics Department. But in 1.5 years due coronovirus the company had been closed and I moved to International logistics company, that decided to open the Minsk Branch. Here I developed English communications skills a little bit and focus on rail shipments from China to Europe and CIS, developed this product that allowed the company to grow new line of product more and more strong. But now in 2022 due sanctions Minsk branch fair off all employees instead of me and I feel alone at the office, moreover logistics sector in Belarus has been reduced a lot due sanction so this is allow me to learn and develop new skills. Then I'll be sure in teh future more. 
My main goal in life - to work at interesting job place, where I can earn enough money in order to live happy life with my family (buy large house, twice per year go to travel everywhere where I want).
